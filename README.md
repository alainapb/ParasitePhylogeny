This project contains the code for: Pfenning-Butterworth AC, Botero-Ca√±ola S, and Cressler CE. On the evolution of host specificity: a case study of helminths

Here we use a reconstructed helminth phylogeny to test whether host specificity is determined by evolutionary history, local ecology, or both. 

Supplemental figures and tables for this project can be found in the the Supplement.pdf and Supplement.Rmd
